# Learning-ZK
This is rust implementation of various concepts while learning Zero Knowledge Proofs. Currently, I am using https://github.com/LeastAuthority/moonmath-manual as a guide for this journey. 

The repo is arranged in folders where the rust implementations reside. 

To get started, you can clone the repo

1. `git clone https://github.com/dic0de/Learning-ZK.git`
2. Move to the repo `cd <folder Name>`
3. Then build and run with `cargo build` and `cargo run`
